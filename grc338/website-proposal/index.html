					<p>    Metro Club offers an ice cream subscription service for vegan and dairy free ice cream deliveries. Why hassle with shopping in store when you could have delicious ice cream delivered right to your door. But Metro Club meant for all ice cream lovers and anyone with a sweet tooth who likes convenience... Doesn't that make all of us? All diets deserve dessert!

					<h1> Our Scoop </h1><!-- Home, About us, Contact, etc. -->
				
					<p>    So what's the scoop? Metropolitan Ice Cream Club started because we know you're tired of having to go shop around the grocery store just to settle for a less than satisfactory icecream, or one that doesn't fit with your dietary restrictions. Why not bring the perfect ice cream right to your door? Unlike similar brands, we don't like diet culture, we aren't trying to make ice cream "skinny" we just want ice cream to be able to be enjoyed by everyone. As they say... I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream! Metro Club hears you, and we have you covered!  </p><!-- This is a placeholder! Change it to the actual content of your page. -->
