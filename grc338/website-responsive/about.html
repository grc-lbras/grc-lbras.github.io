                <h2>The scoop</h2>
            
            <p>    So what's the scoop? Metropolitan Ice Cream Club started because we know you're tired of having to go shop around the grocery store just to settle for a less than satisfactory icecream, or one that doesn't fit with your dietary restrictions. Why not bring the perfect ice cream right to your door? Unlike similar brands, we don't like diet culture, we aren't trying to make ice cream "skinny" we just want ice cream to be able to be enjoyed by everyone. As they say... I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream! Metro Club hears you, and we have you covered!  </p>
